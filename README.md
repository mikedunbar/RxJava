# RxJava Sample Code
Illustrate RxJava principles with short code samples

Currently going along with Reactive Programming in RxJava and will start naming classes according to chapter

There is no attempt made a clean or reusable code - just bang out examples as quick as possible

Current pattern is a simple main method per class that calls various static methods, each of which illustrates a different concept.
They should all be commented-out, and you just uncomment the one you wanna run - to keep output focused and minimal.
